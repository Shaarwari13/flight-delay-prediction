##  Overview
This project predicts whether a flight will be **On Time** or **Delayed** using a **rule-based logic** system implemented in Python.  
Instead of complex machine learning algorithms, it uses real-world conditions such as **delay duration, weather, and peak hours** to make interpretable predictions.

---

##  Features
- Predicts flight delay status (On Time / Delayed)
- Uses simple, explainable rules
- Generates **Confusion Matrix** and **Classification Report**
- Provides visualizations using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**
- Easy to run in **Google Colab** or **VS Code**

---

##  Dataset
The dataset (`flight_delay_data.csv.xlsx`) contains details such as:
- Flight number  
- Airline  
- Departure time  
- Weather condition  
- Delay duration  
- Day of the week  

> Make sure the dataset file is in the same directory as the code before running the program.
